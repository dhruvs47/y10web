                <p style="font-family:monospace;font-size: 20px;background-color: darkgrey;color: white;">Nanotechnology is a science that manipulates matter on the smallest possible scale. Since nanotech deals with such small particles, classical physics will not be able to govern it, thats why it is goverened by quantum mechanics.<br><br>In order to understand the unusual world of nanotechnology, we need to get an idea of the units of measure involved. A centimeter is one-hundredth of a meter, a millimeter is one-thousandth of a meter, and a micrometer is one-millionth of a meter, but all of these are still huge compared to the nanoscale. A nanometer (nm) is one-billionth of a meter, smaller than the wavelength of visible light and a hundred-thousandth the width of a human hair.<img src = confusion.gif></p>

    <h1>How do we create and discover it?</h1>
     <ul>
                <br><br><p style="font-family:monospace;font-size: 20px;background-color: lightsteelblue;color: white;"> Scanning electron microscopes have 5 main parts, the first being the electron gun. This is a pointy cylinder-like structure which is used to create a cloud of heated electrons that will be used to look into the sample. 

Next, we have our anode, this is a metal plate under the electron gun that is positively charged and attracts the electrons towards it. Due to the fact that it has a hole in its center, it starts to turn the cloud of electrons into a beam. Now once the electrons pass through the anode they then go between magnetic lenses. When we run electricity through a wire rolled into a tight coil, the center is filled with a strong force called magnetism. This force pushes inwards on the electron beam and moves it towards the sample. Thus being called a magnetic lens because it bends the beam of electrons the same way that a glass lens bends a beam of light. 

After this reflector coils, also known as scanning coils are used to make a magnetic field that pushes the electrons from side to side “scanning” the sample. But now the real question is how do we detect these electrons to form an image that we can see with our eyes, that’s where the detector comes in. The electrons that come off the sample are then attracted by our detector. These electrons are called secondary electrons and are turned into an electrical current that can be measured by the computer, and then the current is turned into an image on a screen. Some SEM's also have backscattered electron detectors, which work the same as secondary electrons detectors but instead of attracting the secondary electrons they attract the electrons that are directly scattered off the sample, these electrons are called back scattered electrons. Where as secondary electrons are electrons generated as ionization products instead of being directly scattered of the sample.<img src = scan.gif>But this technique does have one major drawback, it cannot look at samples that are wet! This is because if water is introduced into the secondary electron detector it will cause it to malfunction and the electron readings will be inaccurate, just like if you put a non-waterproof phone into water. This is where the Environmental SEM comes in.</p>

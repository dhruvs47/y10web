      <h3><strong>Drug Delivery</strong></h3>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 20px;">Nanotechnology drug delivery applications occur through the use of designed nanomaterials as well as forming delivery systems from nanoscale molecules such as liposomes.

            Nanotechnology in drug delivery has been proven by nanoparticles that can have very unique properties both in vitro and in vivo, especially when <strong style="color: black">targeting drug delivery to tumors</strong>. Studies have shown that by applying nanotechnology to drug delivery we can see results such as: <strong style="color: black">improving the ability to deliver drugs</strong> that arenâ€™t very <em>water soluble</em>; target specific sites to reduce the accumulation of the drug within healthy tissue; to help retain the drug in the body long enough for <strong style="color: black">effective treatment</strong>; allow for the transportation of drugs across epithelial and endothelial barriers and to be able to combine therapeutic and diagnostic modalities into one agent.<center><img src="bluecell.png"></center></p>
       <br><br> <h3><strong>Heart Disease Treatment</strong></h3>
            <p style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 20px;">Nanotechnology is also being used to advance and improve heart disease treatments. Coronary artery disease is the progressive plaque formation on the major arteries that can lead to heart failure.

Nanomedicine is a valid treatment in this situation since the development of this specific disease occurs at the cellular level. The current methods out there today of coronary artery disease consists of using statins, known to cause side effects which limit their application. Nanotechnology can provide a more effective and effecient solution.<center><img src="redcell.png"></center></p>

      <h3><strong>Solar Panels</strong></h3>
        <p style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 20px;">Nanotechnology can dramatically improve design and manufacturing of PV films. However, nanotechnology within this industry will really shine when it comes to solar cell technologies, where novel technologies such as <strong style="color: black;">nanowires, quantum dots, as well as radial junctions</strong> will come together to really improve the PV efficiency.

            Nanostructures can also allow <strong style="color: black;">efficient solar cells</strong>to be made from cheaper, more traditional materials, like silicon and titanium dioxide. Although there will be cost barriers involved in developing mass production techniques for nano-enhanced PV cells, the use of cheaper raw materials will allow the cost of commercial solar cells to continue to decrease.<center><img src='solar.gif'></center></p>
        
    <h3><strong>Water Treatment</strong></h3>
        <p  style="font-family: monospace;font-size: 20px;">Some of the most used <strong style='color: black;'>water purification methods</strong> include screening, filtration, sedimentation, reverse osmosis and many more. Despite the value and usefullness of these methods, they are super expensive and require a ton of energy and water to complete.

            <strong style='color: black;'>Nanotechnology based water filtration and purification processes are much more efficient and effective compared to conventional methods</strong> and techniques since these innovative solutions can be created with features that enhance the absorptiono of materials from water. A solid example of this lies wihtin properties such as reactivity and volume as well as interactions that can be manipulated at the nanolevel in water treatment solutions to generate high performace results at an affordable costs.<center><img src='water.gif'></center></p>
